# Regression Analysis

- It is a branch of supervised learning which models and analyse the relationship between dependent(y) variable and oneor more independent variables(x)

## Steps for Regression Analysis

- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess the data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis.

- Model Selection: Choose an appropriate regression model based on the characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.

- Feature Selection: Determine which independent variables (features) to include in the model

- Model Training: Use the training data to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of the regression model.

- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the regression model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) e.t.c.
